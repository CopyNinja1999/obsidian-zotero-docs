# Inserting Citation

Using obsidian-zotero plugin, you can easily insert citations in your notes, using command or editor suggest.

## Editor Suggest

<video autoPlay loop muted playsInline width="300">
  <source src="/img/citation-insert-editor.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <Image
    src="/img/citation-insert-editor.gif"
    alt="citation insert with editor suggest"
    width="200"
    height="0"
  />
</video>

<Steps>

### Activate citations suggest

Enter `[@` in your note, and you will see a list of citations to choose from.

### Search for citation

You can search for citation by continuing to type your query.

Currently you can search by title, author, and year.

### Insert citation

Select the citation you want to insert, and press `Enter` to insert it. By default, it will insert the citation in the [Pandoc favor of citation](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-citations) (`[@citationkey]`).

You can insert alternative citation format by leaving a `/` after the query before pressing `Enter`. For example, `[@citationkey/]` will insert the citation in alternative format.

</Steps>

Citation format can be configured in the plugin settings. Check out the [previous section](/getting-started/basic-usage/template-config) for more details.

## Command

You can also insert citation using `Zotero Plugin: Insert Markdown Citation` command.
The steps are similar to the editor suggest, except that you can use `shift`+`Enter` to insert the citation in alternative format.

By default, no keybinding is assigned to this command.
