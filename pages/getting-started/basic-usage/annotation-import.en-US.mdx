# Importing Annotations from Zotero

In this section of the tutorial, we will walk you through the process of importing your annotations from the Zotero PDF reader into Obsidian. This feature is essential to maintain synchronization between your reading and note-taking activities.

With the Obsidian-zotero tool, this process has been simplified to a few clicks, saving you the trouble of manually copying annotations.

Here are the step-by-step instructions:
