# How-to for Template of Note Properties

Leave your needs in the comment section below and we will add them to the list.

## Include only manually created tags

To include only manually created tags, not the ones retrieved from literature, use the following code:

```ejs copy
tags: [<%= it.tags.filter(t => t.type === 0) %>]
```

<Callout>
In Zotero, manually created tags have value 0, while the ones retrieved from literature have value 1.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
This is the default behavior before the change in v1.1.0.
</Callout>

## Get when the literature was imported to Zotero

```ejs copy
import-date: <%= it.dateAccessed %>
```

## Get the full list of authors

### with the full name

```ejs copy
authors: [<%= it.authors %>]
```

### with first name or last name

```ejs copy
authors: [<%= it.authors.map(v => v.firstName) %>]
# or
authors: [<%= it.authors.map(v => v.lastName) %>]
```

<Callout>
Do note that first name and last name are not always available. 
</Callout>
